# WPC GIS Curb Ramp Inventory App

In progress. Mobile web app for doing corner/curb ramp inventories in the field, can be modified for other purposes. Uses data stored in CartoDB. Originally built with OpenLayers & jQuery but now transitioning over to Leaflet for better speed and compatibility with multiple devices.
